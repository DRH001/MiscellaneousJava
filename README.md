# MiscellaneousJava

This is a repository containing a lot of my random Java projects from several years ago (a few are somewhat recent, like `TaylorSeriesOfSine` or `FractionApproximator` - I occasionally make use of Java to make my life easier for certain things). 


None of these classes are intended to be production-quality code. In the older files, I usually did not follow proper formatting guidelines (as I was more concerned with learning the language itself rather than formatting it to look nice). In the newer files, the formatting may be a bit better but I still did not care enough to get it to production quality, as the code is usually quite short and was used only for personal projects where I knew I wouldn't need to maintain any code.

Unfortunately, none of my recent Java code (which is production quality unlike what's shown here) has been open-source, so I cannot share it here. I have included a document, `Coding Standards`, which outlines a few of the coding guidelines which I currently follow to make my code as readable as possible
