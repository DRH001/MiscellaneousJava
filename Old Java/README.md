This folder contains some of my better projects. Among the very best are `GameOfLife4`, `J11Q3`, and `aMAZEing`.

Most of these projects are actually Java Applets - so you will need to run them with the Java 1.4.2_19 SDK. Yes, this is a version of Java from 1998, but it still works 
(you don't need to install Java 2, you just need to download the SDK and it will work with any modern version of Java).
To run any of the applets, you need to place the applet's Java and HTML files into the bin folder of the SDK. Next, open a command prompt in the bin folder
(either open it directly from the folder or open cmd and navigate to the folder). 
Finally, type `appletviewer [name of project].html` (for example, appletviewer GameOfLife4.html).







The proper version of the SDK can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-javase-v14-downloads.html) - scroll down until you reach 1.4.2_19.
