COMMENTS:
lines of code which are not intuitive must be commented
functions which are not blatantly intuitive must have a comment under the declaration (something like `int add(int a, int b){return(a+b);}` would not need to be commented...)
line comments under variable or method initializations (about variable initializations), next initializations: 2
unrelated line comments, anything: 1 (true)
block comment, anything: 1 (true)
//*/ block comments (to make code commented/not commented fast), anything: 3, true
any comments referencing an above line, above line: 0

block comments in code are used for method function descriptions
docstrings in code (not default docstring) are to-do lists, reminders, or links that will be taken out of final production code
